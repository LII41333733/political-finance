There he began learning the SAP enterprise system and soon embarked on a consulting career at IBM. After a few years of travel and settling in at one of its service delivery centers, his assignment and his time at IBM had run its course. Although treated well, the life behind a computer all day in a cubicle, office, or boiler room with no natural light began to weigh on his soul and his psyche. So, in 2005, faced with the prospect of being on an airplane every week for a second stint, he left IBM for a new life as an entrepreneur trying to capitalize on the motorcycle, tattoo, and t-shirt embellishment trend. The irony was that he had to leave one of the most esteemed companies in the information industry that offered many opportunities within the IT sphere to explore an untapped part of his brain.

The government, having an interest in the revenues from the manufacture of pins is motivated to become involved at the behest of the manufacturer. At this, Great Britain deploys ships of the finest Navy ever assembled. The ships either bombard the land to secure access for the salesman or secure it by mere presence and intimidation. The salesman proceeds to the local markets and finds that the people in the foreign land do not want the pins or have no need for them.
