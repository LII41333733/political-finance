As “capitalism” and wealth were used to apologize for transgressions against the natural laws of supply and demand and humanity, the people of the United States ceded not only to the potential of prosperity but to the peace that goes along with it. The books also analyze root causes and patterns in the commercial and banking arenas known as panics and depressions.

Bill\n                        graduated from Audubon High School in 1981 and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in business from\n                        Rutgers University in 1986. While attending both of those institutions, he spent a significant amount of his\n                        energy on the baseball field toward a well-rounded life and achieved area and state honors.</p>\n                        <p className=\"textBlock\">After working in the waste, construction, and electronics industries, Bill returned to Rowan University in 1993\n                        where he received a public school teaching certification. During his post-baccalaureate study, he began to\n                        develop computer skills and found work in the information technology department at a chemical company in\n                        Philadelphia. There he began learning the SAP enterprise system and soon embarked on a consulting career\n                        at IBM. After a few years of travel and settling in at one of its service delivery centers, his assignment and his\n                        time at IBM had run its course. Although treated well, the life behind a computer all day in a cubicle, office, or\n                        boiler room with no natural light began to weigh on his soul and his psyche. So, in 2005, faced with the\n                        prospect of being on an airplane every week for a second stint, he left IBM for a new life as an entrepreneur\n                        trying to capitalize on the motorcycle, tattoo, and t-shirt embellishment trend. The irony was that he had to\n                        leave one of the most esteemed companies in the information industry that offered many opportunities within\n                        the IT sphere to explore an untapped part of his brain. But creativity and business experience was not enough\n                        to compete with low international labor rates and distribution channels leveraged by the highly capitalized retail\n                        giants in the 21 st century “go big or go home” commercial arena.</p>\n                        <p className=\"textBlock\">These experiences, along with Pacello’s non-political affiliation and effort to adhere to the Christian faith, have\n                        fueled a perspective that will cut into both sides of the mainstream narrative. His first two books, The Art of\n                        Political Finance Part I and II, show the unfolding and proliferation of fiat currency and debt in early America\n                        and how it began to undermine individual freedom, liberty, national independence, and spirit, prior to the\n                        establishment of the Federal Reserve. The research and analysis provide an alternative for readers and young\n                        Americans so that they may better understand the 21 st century bazaar, especially in an America with ratcheted\n                        discord after events like 911 and the “Great Recession” where each generation seems to be more apt to\nconsumption and predation than the former.</p>\n                        <a\n                            target={\"_blank\"}\n                            href=\"#\">\n                            <Button\n                                className=\"m-2 w-50 buyButton inline\">Encourage and Support Independent Analysis</Button></a>\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n            </Container>\n        </>\n    )\n}","import React from \"react\";\nimport Jumbotron from 'react-bootstrap/Jumbotron'\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container'\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row'\nimport Col from 'react-bootstrap/Col'\n\nexport default function JumboTools() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <Jumbotron fluid className=\"jumbotron_tertiary\">\n                <Container>\n                    <Row>\n                        <Col>\n                            <h2 className=\"textCenter\">TOOLS</h2>\n                        </Col>\n                    </Row>\n                </Container>\n            </Jumbotron>\n        </>\n    )\n}","import React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport Card from 'react-bootstrap/Card';\nimport Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button'\nimport OverlayTrigger from 'react-bootstrap/OverlayTrigger'\nimport Tooltip from 'react-bootstrap/Tooltip'\n\n//275 x 170\n\nexport default function ({ arr, hasButton, onClick }) {\n    return arr.map((e, i) => {\n        const { src, title, altText, file, price, caption, tag } = e;\n        return (\n            <>\n                <Card\n                    onClick={onClick ?

When I performed a “cross section” of the mutual funds I found that I\n            owned companies like Comcast, JP Morgan, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, and others several times over. This is not to say\n            that those companies do not perform well but you may want to see how diversified you really are with a cross\nsection. If you’re willing to take on more risk these stocks may not avail those opportunities.</p>\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            module = <div>{whichIndex}</div>\n            break;\n        case 3:\n            module = (\n                <>\n                    <p>I recently read an article that said, “Americans are still bad at investing.” No wonder. Most of us would like to lead “normal” lives without being pinned to the ticker. We would also like to rely on the trust of our fellow Americans called “professionals” to manage our portfolio in our best interest. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, as we Lilliputians have found out in the last few decades. Which brings us back to decision point number one: is your professional acting as a fiduciary? If not, be wary.</p>\n                    <img className=\"w-100\" src=\"images/tools/advisor/1.png\" />\n                    <p>Managers and firms love to show off their charting skills. This is ok as long as they show you the whole picture. As an example, let’s say you had $100,000 in an IRA and you wanted to assess its performance over the last year or so. Your broker may provide a graph like the following: </p>\n                    <p>Growth looks good right? But  maybe there’s more to the story. Here’s the data behind the graph:</p>\n                    <img className=\"w-75 mx-auto d-block\" src=\"images/tools/advisor/1a.png\" />\n                    <p className=\"mt-3\">As you can see from the totals, the income returns from reinvested dividends made up 81% of the growth realized during this period of a poor 2.7% overall return shown in the ending balance. The bottom line is, force your professional to break out and show you the components of your returns; market vs. reinvestments. In periods of slow growth or downturns the market can wipe out the income. A good advisor may provide options to avoid this scenario.</p>\n\n                </>\n            );\n            break;\n    }\n    return (\n        <>\n            <h2 className=\"textColorPrimary

The leaders in\n                    many countries want to get back to “business as usual”\n                    pitting the risk of infection and death against economic\n                    “disaster.” This conflict has shed new light on the lauded\n                    quote by James Carville: “It’s the economy stupid.” Is it?\n                    Is that what Americans want and believe to be the acme\n                    of freedom and liberty? Let’s look at the term economy.\n                    In simple terms it’s derived from, “how’s your house?”\n                    Before we answer that we have to answer, “what is our\n                    house?” Is the United States of America a democracy, as\n                    popularly touted from the public school system to the\n                    mainstream news media, is it a republic as once\n                    established, is it a commercial corporation, the extension\n                    of which mirrors the British or Dutch East Indies\n                    companies, run solely for profit where the shareholders\n                    are made whole or bailed out every time it goes belly up,\n                    or is it either a de facto or de jure empire or colony thereof\n                    under the guise of all of the above?\n            </p>\n                <p>\n                    If we are an empire and the population has ceded to that\n                    fact with bromides like “well you have to pay the\n                    mortgage,” then who is the King or Queen? Is he or she\n                    the debt holder, aka the bondholder, of a debt that was\n                    contrived from fiat? Have you ever wondered why the\n                    United States of America, billed as the most productive and free country in the history of mankind has\n                    accumulated a $22 trillion debt and rising? The Federal Reserve wants to play the white knight and infuse more\n                    money into the system to provide the ability for Americans to eat, pay their taxes, pay their rents and mortgages\n                    and “go back to business as usual.” Can you guess what’s on the other side of that money? If you said “debt,”\n                    you can clearly see why the Federal Reserve wants the song to remain the same.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    We all want relief. More money – printed money with a debt-basis – does not provide relief. For all you mothers\n                    out there, do you want your children to be saddled with more debt? This is the formula that’s been implemented\n                    by the oligarchs for over 150 years, before the Federal Reserve. It’s not an American precept. It’s not a Godly\n                    precept. Even Alexander Hamilton said, “a national debt, IF NOT EXCESSIVE, will be to us a national blessing.\n                    In perspective, this quote was made at the beginning of a country which needed credit. It only took 50 years to\n                    pay the debt off, proven by Andrew Jackson. After 250 years, The United States of America, moreover its citizens,\n                    has proven that hard work and enterprise “trump” most challenges that have been posed to humanity.

The\n                    farmer would prick the animal to steer it\n                    in the right direction. Sometimes the\n                    animal would rebel by kicking out at the\n                    prick, and this would result in the prick\n                    being driven even further into its flesh.\n                    The following story has a similar lesson.\n                    Unfortunately, the pricks were not of the\n                    farmer.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Recorded in “Wealth of Nations,” Adam\n                    Smith claimed to be a witness of one of\n                    the simplest examples of the successful\n                    divisions of labor. A pin factory\n                    discovered the exponential increase in\n                    productivity when the manufacturing of\n                    a pin was broken down into 18 separate\n                    tasks. “One man draws out the wire,\n                    another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it,”etc., and by dividing the labor, twenty men with specialized\n                    skills could make an astonishing forty-eight thousand pins in a day. When those 18 operations were performed\n                    by one man, Smith claimed that nary a pin was made in a day. Smith also pointed out that the multiplication\n                    afforded by this division of labor worked better in manufacturing than agriculture. So if your primary goal is\n                    monetary gain, do you enter the arena of agriculture or manufacturing? This was the primary motivation that\n                    transformed our country from agriculture to industry, which in itself is not necessarily contemptible. But what\n                    happens when markets are saturated?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Looking at the example that Smith provides, a pin factory on the island of Great Britain that produced 48,000\n                    pins a day would quickly run out of customers regardless of price – price decreasing with more production and\n                    less demand. As Jeff Madrick points out in his article entitled, “How the Invisible Hand Was Corrupted by\n                    Laissez-Faire Economics,” the size of the market was every bit as critical as output—and maybe more so—and\n                    has usually been overlooked by contemporary economists. The division of labor and other productivity\n                    improvements could only be made if the market was large enough. What good would it be to make forty-eight\n                    thousand pins rather than two hundred if there was no need for those pins? And so, markets had to expand\n                    beyond the village, the region, the nation, and the world. <sup>i</sup>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The next question became, “how does a merchant expand his market?” Naturally he would either travel to\n                    foreign lands to sell his pins or hire someone to do it. As he has to supervise his operation, he appropriately\n                    hires someone. So, the salesman travels to the foreign land. But in doing so he is met with resistance and turned\n                    away with no opportunity to sell. Upon his return and report to the factory owner, the proprietor is outraged.\n                    Faced with this challenge and the will to survive (the self-interest that Smith posited was the marrow of wealth)\n                    he turns to his government and relates the problem. The government, having an interest in the revenues from\n                    the manufacture of pins is motivated to become involved at the behest of the manufacturer. At this, Great Britain\n                    deploys ships of the finest Navy ever assembled. The ships either bombard the land to secure access for the\n                    salesman or secure it by mere presence and intimidation. The salesman proceeds to the local markets and finds\n                    that the people in the foreign land do not want the pins or have no need for them. Upon his return to the factory,\n                    the owner is perplexed by “these stupid, parochial, provincial, simple, uneducated, uncivilized, and backward\n                    people. They don’t realize how these pins can help their lives.”\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Once the battleships provided security for the pin merchant, the real bombardment ensued. The bombardment\n                    of bromides, not only by salesmen in the markets but by sermons, presses, speeches by government officials,\n                    and eventually institutions of higher learning (universities). And as an entire culture was captivated, in the end\n                    it was a very visible hand that guided the market, followed by promises and platitudes of the factory owner.\n                    With the cultural change came new customers, new workers, and a new “civilization.”\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    But the factory owner and the governments were not satisfied. The factory owner found it too costly to\n                    manufacture the pins in Great Britain and ship them to the new land. With the same military might from the\n                    motherland, the factory owner acquired property in his new territory and built a factory. As all the arable land\n                    was exhausted, the inhabitants had no way of sustaining themselves lest they work in the factory for wages. The\n                    land, which provided a year’s worth of sustenance in only eight months of toil or less, was exchanged for twelve\n                    months of toil and the permission to sustain oneself on day to day basis, as long as one showed up for work,\n                    stayed in line, and made his quota.\n                </p>\n            </>),\n            footer: (\n                <p><sup>i</sup> Madrick, Jeff.“How the Invisible Hand Was Corrupted by Laissez- Faire Economics.” <em>Evonomics</em>, 3 May 2018</p>\n            )\n        },\n        {\n            title: \"Impeach King Trump\",\n            thumbSrc: `images/articles/trump-thumb.png`,\n            src: `images/articles/trump.png`,\n            date: `March 12, 2019`,\n            body: (<>\n                <p>\n                    For three years we have heard calls for the impeachment of President Trump for any number of alleged infractions; Russian collusion, bribing porn stars, or just being an embarrassment to America. If we measure the present against history, a practice we should all become accustomed to, we should look at of those same calls pointed at other presidents. In the graphic above by the famous Harper’s Weekly, a publication with a Republican slant, the 1866 cartoon by Thomas Nast identifies Democratic President Andrew Johnson as King Andy I. In 1833 another cartoonist gave the same moniker to Andrew Jackson, an even stronger-willed Democratic President.</p>\n                <p>\n                    According to David O. Stewart, author of, “Impeached: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln’s Legacy,” Johnson was an official with a good resume but wasn’t necessarily one you could warm up to. He wasn’t known for using humor like his witty predecessor. Even fellow Democrat, James Polk once described him as vindictive and perverse.</p>\n                <p>\n                    In 1866, with the social climate changin\n                        , things were tense in the South. Johnson was noted for saying that the country’s greatest risk was that enfranchised blacks were going to “Africanize the South.” In addition to these cultural and racial differences, Johnson exercised vetoes of the Civil Rights Act and Reconstruction laws that Congress overrode, but blacks, white sympathizers (“scalawags”) and military personnel were still at risk. Other political confrontations came from the Republicans who were considered “radical.” They didn’t want the Democrats – who, with all of their misgivings, were the conservatives of the period – to re-establish dominance or participation in government. During the war and shortly after the Republicans passed a raft of radical monetary policy ex parte in order to maintain the superiority of the banks and the bondholders - many of them foreign. In doing so they proclaimed the sanctity of the “credit of the United States.” With Johnson in the presidency, the battle of supremacy between Congress and the executive crept up again; a similar battle that Jackson had forty years prior with the Second Bank of the United States and Congress.</p>\n                <p>\n                    Stewart cites the main battle that led to Johnson’s impeachment was between Johnson and Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton who usurped Johnson’s authority when it came to military execution of the Reconstruction laws. In turn, Johnson wanted to replace Stanton. Since the Constitution wasn’t explicit about cabinet dismissals, the\n                        Republican Congress conveniently created the Tenure of Office Act that required Congress to approve the president’s cabinet members and such firings. Regardless, Johnson appointed Lorenzo Thomas to the post in which Stanton and Thomas bickered back and forth as to who was the actual Secretary. While Thomas attended cabinet meetings, Stanton occupied the War Department offices for three months. In anticipation of staying longer, Stanton sent a sergeant to his home for food clothes and bed linens. Mrs. Stanton refused the request and nstructed the sergeant to tell her husband to resign immediately and come straight home.</p>\n                <p>\n                    Johnson, who was eventually impeached, somehow survived by getting seven of the 19 votes needed for acquittal from the adversarial party. Stewart cites five reasons Johnson was able to get the seven votes. Among them were, dislike for Johnson’s would be successor, patience on the side of Republicans who knew Grant was soon to be the next president in 1868, and of course something else that’s not discussed in polite society, patronage and cash bribes.<sup>i</sup></p>\n                <p>\n                    The reconcilable challenges to 21<sup>st</sup>-century partisans bearing this history are, for Republicans, acknowledging that their party was once the radical or liberal party that espoused early globalism through monetary and fiscal policy, and for Democrats, that their party leaned toward white supremacy but held to fiscal conservatism. Both Kings, both Andrews, both Democrats, both conservatives, went head to head with the bank party and Congress. Both were criticized and demonized by the liberal press. There was one other famous impeachment hearing of a Democratic president (Bill Clinton) but that’s another story entirely. President Trump appears to be experiencing the same in his fight with Congress and the “swamp.” As Americans, we have to ask if Congress is truly representative of the “people.” Many Americans don’t seem to think so, unless our definition of “people” is inaccurate. In attempting to stop this spin – what we do here at NJRedpill.com – we have to ask ourselves, if Congress is still the bank party – supporting Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, etc., - regardless of nominal designations, do we want President Trump impeached?

Below is an illustration which appears to be signed by William Rogers\n                    of Harper’s Weekly. It depicts\n                    the condition of an employee\n                    who worked at the Pullman\n                    Palace Car Company and lived\n                    in the town of Pullman,\n                    Illinois, both owned by George\n                    Pullman. The image is the\n                    progenitor of two other\n                    illustrations I took the liberty\n                    of modifying to show the\n                    different stages of a command\n                    economy. There are fine lines\n                    between capitalism, socialism,\n                    and free market. Some of the\n                    characteristics of each are\n                    shown on the plates of the\n                    economic vises.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The second image, shown\n                    below, was modified to reflect\n                    the pressure that railroad\n                    owners, also known\n                    euphemistically as “managers,” like JP Morgan and Jay Gould had on farmers due to the high prices of\n                    transportation resulting from cartelization. In the late 19th century railroads became so prolific, partly due to the\n                    hard work and productivity of Americans, that the cost of a rail ticket was declining based on the NATURAL\n                    LAW of price = supply + demand. Railroad owners didn’t accept this law, so they entered into agreements to\n                    consolidate roads and set prices. This of course was business as usual for industrial capitalists who made their\n                    own rules. Rather than create legislation that prohibited these agreements and trusts, most government officials\n                    participated via subsidizing these roads. This stance was in direct opposition to the laissez-faire approach to\n                    which many of us were indoctrinated. Officials clearly sided with the consolidated capital donor class through\n                    the labor disputes of the 19th century.\n                </p>\n                <img className={\"float-left\"} src=\"images/articles/vise2.png\" />\n                <p>\n                    So far, the free-market system\n                    seems to bring the most\n                    fairness to the masses over any\n                    other economic system that\n                    has been defined by economic\n                    pundits of the modern era and\n                    imposed by bureaucrats.\n                    Having not studied any one\n                    economist in depth, we can get\n                    an idea from a few of the\n                    better-known economists at\n                    the cursory level: Adam\n                    Smith, Karl Marx, Ludwig von\n                    Mises, John Kenneth\n                    Galbraith, Milton Friedman,\n                    John Maynard Keynes, and\n                    others. They all have one thing\n                    in common, they are all\n                    theorists who spend their time\n                    in the laboratory. Marx and others did infuse practicality, but the socialism that emerged was far from ideal or practical. The lab is not\n                    necessarily a bad thing, but as a teacher if you don’t take feedback from your practitioners or those outside of\n                    the laboratory you may fall victim to hubris.\n                </p>\n                <p>This brings me to a real example regarding the invention of the chronometer, the Royal Society, and a man\n                named John Harrison. John Harrison was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the\n                marine chronometer. In an attempt to eliminate or reduce losses at sea due to navigational errors, the Royal\n                Society had officially invited proposals to solve the problem of calculating longitude while at sea. Harrison's\n                solution revolutionized navigation and greatly increased the safety of long-distance sea travel. However, since\n                he was a commoner, or someone not affiliated with the Royal Society or the Universities, he had difficulty getting\n                full recognition and remunerated for his invention, which was part of the promise and incentive made by the\nRoyal Society.</p>\n                <p>\n                    This leads us to the dialectic of economists. Was there ever a free market? Let’s assume for argument’s sake that\n                    Adam Smith was a proponent of the free market (the thesis) and Karl Marx was a proponent of socialism (the\n                    antithesis). Since the free market did not reign in monopoly, calls for fairness, true free markets, and socialism\n                    grew. The graphic of the dialectic may look something like this today:\n                </p>\n                <img className={\"d-block mx-auto\"} src=\"images/articles/vise3.png\" />\n                <p>\n                    As you can see from the illustration above, part of the plates of the vise that humanity feels is due to the central\n                    command of both the thesis and the antithesis; the resulting vise shown below.\n\n                    Centrally controlled\n                    economies were not a\n                    characteristic of a free\n                    society. This was a\n                    characteristic of a\n                    command economy\n                    associated with the 20th\n                    century Soviet Union\n                    and its unilateral\n                    Communist Party. As\n                    the bipartisan system\n                    seems to apply equal\n                    pressure, what does it\n                    say about the current\n                    condition in the United\n                    States of America?
